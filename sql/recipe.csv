2;"Grandma's Spaghetti sauce";"This is one that was recited to me out of memory alone, and described as a hand of garlic, etc., though the ingredient quantities should be accurate. I encourage buying the cheapest versions of these ingredients you can find; it will feed an army for about $15 without ruining the taste. You should add more seasonings based on preference. A great vegetarian sauce, and with meatballs...it makes great meatball sandwiches.";"";0;"Spaghetti-Sauce.jpg";240;90;8;""

4;"Smoked salmon";"I smoke a lot of salmon, and I am proud of this recipe, although it would be the height of arrogance to say that what I do is the end-all, be-all of salmon smoking recipes. Lots of people smoke their salmon in lots of ways, and many of them are good. But I've been smoking fish for many years, and I've developed a system that works well.";"";0;"smoked-salmon.jpg";60;15;6;""
5;"Baked Fish Tacos with Avocado";"Instead of deep-frying, the fish fillets in this quick-and-easy 5-ingredient recipe are coated with a flavorful seasoning blend and baked. Several varieties of flaky white fish can be used for these tacos.
